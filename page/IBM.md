| [knowledge-enabled-textual-entailment](https://github.com/IBM/knowledge-enabled-textual-entailment) | Natural Language Inference is fundamental to many Natural Language Processing applications such as semantic search and question answering. The task of NLI has gained significant attention in the recent times due to the release of fairly large scale, challenging datasets. Present approaches that address NLI are largely focused on learning based on the given text in order to classify whether the given premise entails, contradicts, or is neutral to the given hypothesis. On the other hand, techniques for Inference, as a central topic in artificial intelligence, has had knowledge bases playing an important role, in particular for formal reasoning tasks. While, there are many open knowledge bases that comprise of various types of information, their use for natural language inference has not been well explored. In this work, we present a simple technique that can harnesses knowledge bases, provided in the form of a graph, for natural language inference. | Jupyter Notebook | 42 | Apache License 2.0 | 2018-08-09 | 2024-09-05 | 2022-12-08 |

All of the agents in the virtual world have actions governed by statistical distributions.  Thus the model and data are NOT based on obfuscating or anonymizing real individuals.  Everything is synthetic.  More specifically the underlying model uses a virtual world of banks, individuals, and companies -- with individuals and companies buying items, and doing bank transfers to make payments, get supplies, pay salaries, etc.  The underlying model has good and bad actors, with bad actors doing things like smuggling, extortion, illegal gambling, etc.  The bad actors sometimes attempt to launder ill-gotten funds resulting in money-laundering transactions.
